# Product Context: Chorus Backend

## Problem Space

The Chorus platform requires a centralized and reliable backend to manage its data, business logic, and user interactions. Without a dedicated backend, features like user authentication, data persistence, and service integration would be difficult to manage, scale, and secure. This backend provides the core foundation for all client-facing applications.

## How It Should Work

The backend should operate as a set of services accessible via a well-documented API. The primary interaction model is client-server, where clients (e.g., web or mobile applications) make requests to the backend's API to perform actions or retrieve data.

Key user flows from a backend perspective include:
1.  **User Registration & Login**: New users can create an account, and existing users can log in securely.
2.  **Data Management**: Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete resources they have access to.
3.  **Service Interaction**: The backend orchestrates interactions between different services (e.g., `workbench`, `workspace`) to deliver cohesive features.

## User Experience Goals

While the backend does not have a direct user interface, its design and performance are critical to the overall user experience.
- **Responsiveness**: The API should respond to requests quickly to ensure a smooth client-side experience.
- **Reliability**: The system should be highly available and resilient to errors.
- **Security**: User data must be protected at all times through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
