# Project Brief: Chorus Backend

## Core Mission

This project is the backend for the Chorus platform. Its primary role is to provide a robust and scalable server-side infrastructure that supports the features and services offered by Chorus.

## Project Goals

- **Define Clear APIs**: Use Protocol Buffers and OpenAPI to create well-defined, versioned, and documented APIs for client applications.
- **Ensure System Reliability**: Implement comprehensive testing (unit, acceptance) and maintain a high level of code quality.
- **Secure and Authenticated Access**: Provide secure user management, authentication, and authorization using JWTs and middleware.
- **Automated Infrastructure**: Leverage a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and Kubernetes for automated builds, testing, and deployments.
- **Manage Data Evolution**: Use a structured migration system to handle database schema changes across development, testing, and production environments.

## Scope

The backend encompasses the following key areas:
- API endpoints for all platform features.
- User and authentication services.
- Data storage and retrieval logic.
- Business logic for all services.
- Infrastructure for deployment and operations.

## Funding & Licensing

This project is part of the Horizon Europe project "EBRAINS 2.0" and has received funding from the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI). Any commercial use of the software requires prior permission from CHUV.
