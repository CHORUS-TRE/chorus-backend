# Active Context: Chorus Backend

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the project's "Memory Bank" documentation. This involves creating the initial set of core documentation files that capture the project's context, architecture, and technical details.

## Recent Changes

- The `docs/memory-bank/` directory has been created.
- The initial versions of the following memory bank files have been drafted:
  - `projectbrief.md`
  - `productContext.md`
  - `systemPatterns.md`
  - `techContext.md`

## Next Steps

1.  **Create `progress.md`**: Draft the initial `progress.md` file to capture the current status of the project.
2.  **User Review**: The user needs to review all the generated memory bank files to ensure they are accurate and complete.
3.  **Refine and Update**: Based on user feedback, update the memory bank files.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The content of the memory bank files is based on an initial analysis of the repository (`README.md`, `go.mod`, file structure). It may require refinement from someone with deeper project knowledge.
- We are currently in "Plan Mode". No code changes beyond creating these documentation files will be made until the user approves and we switch to "Act Mode".
