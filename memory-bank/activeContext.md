# Active Context: Chorus Backend

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on updating the project's "Memory Bank" documentation to reflect the latest understanding of the project structure, particularly the inclusion of the `workbench-operator`.

## Recent Changes

-   The initial set of memory bank files has been reviewed.
-   Discovered the `workbench-operator` as a separate, significant component within the repository.
-   Reviewed the root `Makefile` to understand development workflows.

## Next Steps

1.  **Propose Updated Memory Bank**: Present the updated memory bank files (`activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) for user review.
2.  **Await User Approval**: Wait for the user to approve the changes before concluding the "Plan Mode".

## Active Decisions & Considerations

-   The `workbench-operator` is a key architectural component and must be properly documented.
-   The `Makefile` provides helpful development shortcuts that should be noted in the `techContext.md`.
-   We are currently in "Plan Mode". No code changes beyond updating these documentation files will be made until the user approves.
