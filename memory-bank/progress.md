# Progress: Chorus Backend

## What Works

Based on the `README.md` and project structure, the following components appear to be implemented and functional:

- **Core Backend Server**: The application can be started, and it serves an API.
- **API Documentation**: An OpenAPI UI is generated and available.
- **Key Services**: Services for Authentication, User, Workspace, and Workbench are implemented.
- **Database Migrations**: A migration system is in place and has been used to set up the initial schema.
- **Local Development Environment**: Scripts and configurations are available to set up a local development environment using Kind and Docker.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Both unit and acceptance testing frameworks are set up.

## What's Left to Build

- **Complete Feature Implementation**: While the service structure is in place, the `README.md`'s "todo" for tests suggests that not all features may be fully tested or implemented.
- **Refine `workbench-operator`**: The `workbench-operator` directory exists, but its level of completion and integration is not fully clear from the initial analysis.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: The `README.md` explicitly marks the testing section for the "add a new service" guide as `// todo`, indicating that more work is needed on the testing front.
The `workbench-operator/README.md` lists several TODOs:
- Handling the whole life cycle when the user stops the Server from within.
- Report various information in the `/status` for the applications.
- TLS between the Xpra server and the applications.
- An admission webhook.

## Current Status

- The project is in an active development phase.
- The foundational architecture is well-established, and there's a clear pattern for adding new functionality.
- The project includes a functional, self-contained Kubernetes operator (`workbench-operator`) for managing complex application deployments.
- The immediate next step is to review and confirm the accuracy of the updated Memory Bank documentation.

## Known Issues

- No specific issues are documented in the `README.md`. A more in-depth review of the code or issue trackers would be needed to identify known bugs or technical debt.
